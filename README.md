# Cadastral Map 
A cadastral map is a map which provides detailed information about real property within a specific area. A simple example of a cadastral map might be a map of a village which shows the boundaries of all of the parcels or lots within the village, although cadastral maps can show other types of areas as well. These maps are usually maintained by the government, and they are a matter of public record; anyone who wishes to go to the office which maintains the records can ask to see them.

After taking digital images of the UAV, the images were processed in Metashape software and orthophotos were prepared.
After preparing the orthophoto, it is time to draw different layers of the area, including urban buildings, agricultural lands, mosques and schools, etc.
